Project Title: Web Scraping, Data Cleaning, and Exploratory Data Analysis on Laptops Dataset

Project Description:
    This project involves building a comprehensive pipeline to extract, process, and analyze laptop-related data from online sources. The workflow is divided into three key components:

1.Web Scraping:
    The project begins by leveraging web scraping techniques using tools such as Selenium and undetected-chromedriver.The scraper navigates through the target website (SmartPrix) to extract detailed information on laptops, dynamically loading additional content by interacting with "Load More" buttons. This approach ensures that data from multiple pages and various product listings are collected efficiently.

2.Data Cleaning:
  Once the data is extracted, the next phase involves rigorous data cleaning. The raw dataset often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and redundant information. Data cleaning processes include:
  ->Removing duplicates and handling missing entries.
  ->Standardizing formats for numerical and categorical data.
  ->Filtering out irrelevant or erroneous records.
  ->Transforming and normalizing variables for consistency.
  This step ensures the dataset is reliable and ready for insightful analysis.

3.Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
  With a clean dataset, the final phase focuses on exploratory data analysis. EDA techniques are applied to uncover underlying patterns and trends within the laptop market. Key aspects of the EDA include:
  ->Visualizing distributions of prices, specifications, and ratings.
  ->Identifying correlations between variables such as price, performance, and brand popularity.
  ->Analyzing market trends over time and comparing different product segments.
  ->Generating interactive plots using libraries like Plotly to enable dynamic data exploration.
